# NgTimePastPipe

Transform anything that can be parsed to a Date in the past, to a string which represent the relative
time that has been passed between now and this point of time.
   
This is a rewrite of the orphaned project [AndrewPoyntz Time-ago-pipe](https://github.com/AndrewPoyntz/time-ago-pipe).
It's a hard fork and should provide a better performance and compatibility.
